This program introduces fundamental concepts of programming on UNIX systems.
It reads integers and characters from a file and copies the values into a queue, stack, and a linked list.
The 'main.c', 'functions.c' and 'header.h' files make up the entire program.
main.c has the primary function.
function.c has functions for lists and arrays.
header.h has funtion prototypes.
'file1.txt' contains the numbers that are used for the code.
The program prints the contents of the three data structures.
